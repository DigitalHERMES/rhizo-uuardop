#
# call		This file is used when the ``call-login'' or ``call-password''
#		commands are used in the sys file with a "*" argument (e.g.,
#		``call-login *'').  The system name is looked up in this file,
#		and the login name and password are used.
#
#		The point of this is that the sys file may then be publically
#		readable, while still concealing the login names and passwords
#		used to connect to the remote system.
#
#		The format is just system-name login-name password.
