# This configuration file is used by uudemon.day
# uudemon.day is run daily from cron.daily and sends status information
# to the administrator. It also bounces old mail and kills old news.
# Furthermore it reports a list of old jobs to the admin.
#
# You can configure the time after which news and mail expire as well as how
# old jobs must be so they get reported in the daily status information.
# You can set a global default and override this number for each system.
