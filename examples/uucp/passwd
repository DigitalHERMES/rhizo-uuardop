#
# passwd	If you give access to your UUCP system over TCP to others,
#		and you run uucico directly from crontab, then uucico needs
#		to be able to read the password file to check the password
#		of the remote system.
#
#		With a shadow system that's impossible - only root can read
#		the passwords from the shadow file. Therefore, if you're
#		in that situation, you can define the login passwords
#		here in plain text.
#
#		Format:  loginname <TAB> password
