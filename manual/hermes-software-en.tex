\begin{abstract}

This document contains the description of the software stack of the HERMES
system - a digital communication system for the HF band which uses ARDOP
(Amateur Radio Digital Open Protocol) modem and UUCP networking (Unix to Unix
Communication Protocol). Apart of ARDOP and UUCP, HERMES is composed by a
Web Interface for access to the services it provides and it can be run
on almost any mini-computer.

\section{Reference system}

\begin{itemize}
\item HF transceiver connected to a computer with audio I/O and ptt control
  (see Equipment list document)
\item Mini computer running Linux (and the software stack described by this
  document) connected to the HF transceiver and other networks (eg. WiFi,
  GSM, LTE)
\end{itemize}

\section{What HERMES can do}

HERMES is as a system to be used with HF transceivers for digital
communication. HERMES is meant to work with HF NVIS (near vertical incidence
skywave) and provide hundreds of kilometers of reach for each station.

The modem we currently use (ARDOP) supports both point-to-point mode (ARQ
mode - Automatic repeat request) and broadcast mode (FEC mode - Forward
Error Correction). We only use the ARQ mode, which guarantees the error-free
reception of the data. Broadcast mode could be used, but using a protocol
different than UUCP.

We adopted UUCP as networking solution to be carried over the ARDOP modem in
ARQ mode. UUCP can carry files and execute remote commands. Specific support
for email exists and can be used out-of-the-box to provide email service over
HF (UUCP was created in the late 70's and one of the main uses was email).

In the more basic configuration, HERMES is used for file exchange, with the
option for secure (through cryptography) exchange of files.

\section{HERMES software configuration}

HERMES uses ARDOP (Amateur Radio Digital Open Protocol) for modem. ARDOP is
a SDR (software defined radio) modem made by amateur radio operators which
use modern modulation techniques (OFDM) and have support for standard and
homebrew HF transceivers.

For the network layer, UUCP is used. UUCP is a system for asynchronous
store-and-forward communication first released in the Bell Labs Unix V7 in
the late 70's, and still used today in niches, like communication over HF.

To integrate the UUCP system with the ARDOP modem, the RHIZO-UUArdopD
project was developed to provide tools that integrate UUCP to ARDOP.

A mini-computer running Linux is needed. We recommend Debian Buster (10)
arm64 (multilib with armhf in case you want to use the pre-compiled ``
piardopc '' by John Wiseman) as Linux reference system, running on a Raspberry Pi with
Wifi configured in AP (Access Point) mode, for serving the system web
interface.

We split HERMES network stack in the following items:
\begin{itemize}
\item Computer to Radio connection
\item ALSA (Audio configuration)
\item ARDOP (Modem configuration)
\item UUCP (Network configuration)
\item Rhizo-UUArdopD (UUCP / ARDOP connection tools)
\item User Web Interface
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Computer to Radio connection}

Different setups require different configuration. In the case of using a USB
(Universal Serial Bus) interface (eg. Signalink), the delay setting must be
set to 0. In the case of radios with USB connection exposed an embedded sound
card and transmit/receive control (eg. ICOM IC-7100) leave the bandpass
filter at least 2.8kHz (or wider) for the digital operation (SSB/Data).

\subsection{ALSA (Audio configuration)}

Add to ``/etc/asound.conf'':
\begin{verbatim}
pcm.ARDOP {type rate slave {pcm "hw:1,0" rate 48000}}
\end{verbatim}

Where ``hw:1,0'' is the HF transceiver's audio device.

\subsection{ARDOP (Modem configuration)}

Dowload link: \url{https://github.com/DigitalHERMES/ardopc}

The ardop binary should be in /usr/bin/ardop, which can be a
symbolic link to /usr/bin/{ardop1ofdm, ardop2, ardopofdm}.

ARDOP service file for the ICOM IC-7100 (USB connection, PTT done over serial):
\begin{verbatim}
[Unit]
Description=ARDOP daemon

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=/usr/bin/ardop 8515 -c /dev/ttyUSB0 ARDOP ARDOP -k FEFE88E01C0001FD -u FEFE88E01C0000FD
ExecStop=/usr/bin/killall -s QUIT ardop
IgnoreSIGPIPE=no
#StandardOutput=null
#StandardError=null
StandardOutput=syslog
StandardError=syslog

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
\end{verbatim}

Service file when using a VOX based setup (eg. when using an interface like
the Signalink):
\begin{verbatim}
[Unit]
Description=ARDOP daemon

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=/usr/bin/ardop 8515 ARDOP ARDOP
ExecStop=/usr/bin/killall -s QUIT ardop
IgnoreSIGPIPE=no
#StandardOutput=null
#StandardError=null
StandardOutput=syslog
StandardError=syslog

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
\end{verbatim}


Start/stop ARDOP service:
\begin{verbatim}
systemctl start ardop.service
systemctl stop ardop.service
\end{verbatim}


See the log:
\begin{verbatim}
journalctl -f -u ardop
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{UUCP (Network configuration)}

UUCP debian package version 1.07-27 or higher should be used, for example,
the version from Debian Bullseye (11): \url{https://packages.debian.org/bullseye/uucp}.

UUCP command line examples follow. In order to copy a file to a remote host,
the following command adds a copy job to the uucp queue (``-r'' is used for
not start transmission after queuing):
\begin{verbatim}
uucp -C -r -d source.xxx AM4AAB\!/var/www/html/arquivos/${nodename}/
\end{verbatim}

To trigger the transmission of all queued jobs for host
AM4AAA:
\begin{verbatim}
uucico -S AM4AAA
\end{verbatim}

To list the jobs:
\begin{verbatim}
uustat -a
\end{verbatim}

To kill a job:
\begin{verbatim}
uustat -k job
uustat -K
\end{verbatim}

See the log:
\begin{verbatim}
uulog
\end{verbatim}


\subsection{Rhizo-uuardopd (UUCP / ARDOP connection tools)}

%TODO: It seems everything uucico wrote in the end of a reception, don't get
%to the other side - connection closes and buffer get clean fast!

Two binaries should be installed: uuport (to be called by uucp) and uuardopd
which is the daemon software which connects to the ARDOP modem for starting
/ stopping connection. Rhizo-uuardopd and manages
the connection with UUCP through uucico or uuport.

Download link: \url{http://github.com/DigitalHERMES/rhizo-uuardop}

Start/stop UUARDOPD service:
\begin{verbatim}
systemctl start uuardopd.service
systemctl stop uuardopd.service
\end{verbatim}


See the log:
\begin{verbatim}
journalctl -f -u uuardopd
\end{verbatim}

%\subsection{DHCP}

%\subsection{DNS}

%\subsection{Apache + PHP}


\subsection{User Web Interface}

HERMES provides an interface for file exchange is web-based, using HTML + PHP and
some shell scripts located in ``gui'' directory of Rhizo-Uuardopd source
code
(\url{https://github.com/DigitalHERMES/rhizo-uuardop/tree/master/gui}). Current
implementation supports symmetric cryptography and image compression.

We use ``/var/www/html/arquivos'' as default UUCP path to send
files through the web interface.

Requirements of the user interface:

\begin{itemize}
\item ImageMagic: for image manipulation
\item mozjpeg: Best public JPEG encoder: \url{https://github.com/mozilla/mozjpeg}
% \item opusenc: para comprimir áudio
\item GnuPG: For cryptography
\item hostapd: Wifi AP mode software
\end{itemize}

The Web interface can be accessed by typing any address in a browser
connected to the wifi (set the DNS accordingly) or simply 192.168.1.1.

%\subsection{Email}

%ps: WORK IN PROGRESS

%Email server (MTA) can either run locally or only in a central host with
%Internet. Stations can either opt to connect to a central station on demand,
%have some pre-defined schedule, or the central station connects to the
%community stations doing a pooling, delivering and downloading emails and
%files.

%\subsection{WebPhone}
